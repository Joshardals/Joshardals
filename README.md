- 👋 Hi, I’m @Joshardals
- 👀 I'm a Web Developer/Designer. I started developing websites using HTML, CSS around 3 years ago. Since then, I have taken a keen interest in web development and design, I've become more and more experienced with the languages I use and the environments I work in. I'm a very hard working individual and my greatest pleasure comes from working on a project from start to finish and see it eventually come together as a fully working system.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript 🤓
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Software Development
- 📫 How to reach me: Instagram @joshardals
